WARNING*
*Mobile Money*
The new technique of scammers called *JUMPED*

The scammer makes you a *real deposit* with his number, it's not a *fake deposit*, he really sends you money "a small sum like 2000f or 3000f..." so you tell yourself that It is obviously a deposit.
However, the problem is that as soon as he makes the deposit, right after he launches a *withdrawal on your number*.
So you will certainly be animated by the joy of having received a deposit, check your balance. And for lack of vigilance, you validate his withdrawal request on your account and your account is automatically emptied or half empty.
We just lure you with 2.000f or more and we ruin you.

*To defeat this system*, each time you have received a *deposit*, to check your balance, type a *wrong code*, this will cancel all withdrawal requests, then check your balance with your *real code* , this reflex we must have it to avoid being fooled by these * thugs *.

This is therefore the place for us to share this message with all our contacts in order to be careful because this *new technique* risks doing damage.
