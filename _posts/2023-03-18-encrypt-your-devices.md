When data is **encrypted** , it turns into a seemingly random collection of characters, unless of course you have the decryption key! This is commonly used in messaging apps ( read here for how [https://spreadprivacy.com/how-to-send-private-messages/](https://spreadprivacy.com/how-to-send-private-messages/) ), but it's also easy to encrypt all the data on a device, thanks to this usually being built-in to its operating system. So now there's no excuse not to protect your privacy in this manner!

Follow the steps below for encrypting the devices relevant for you. Once complete, you will only need to enter a password when turning on or waking up your device to automatically decrypt your data.

* Click “Turn On FileVault…”

* IMPORTANT: Make a note of the recovery key that is displayed and store it away from your Mac.
