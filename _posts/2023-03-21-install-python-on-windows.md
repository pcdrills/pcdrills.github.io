⭕️ HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON ON WINDOWS WITHOUT ANY WORRY?

Installing Python is a snap, on both Windows and Unix systems. Regardless of your operating system, you need to go to the official Python site.

Here is the official site link [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)

Windows installation

📌1- Click on the Download link in the main menu of the page.

📌2- Select the version of Python you want to use (I recommend the latest one).

📌3- You are offered one (or more) link (s) to a Windows version: select the one that suits your processor. If in doubt, download an “x86” version.

❗️If your computer tells you that it cannot run the program, try a different version of Python.

📌1- Save then run the installation file and follow the steps. It is neither very long nor very difficult.

📌2- Once the installation is complete, you can go to the
start menu

> All programs.

Python should appear in this list.
