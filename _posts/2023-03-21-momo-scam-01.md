There's a new fraud going on especially with this mobile money.
You sit and someone sends you a message which resembles the deposit message from your operator.
Next, you receive a call with someone claiming to have mistakenly sent it and pleads you resend a fraction of it.
Actually it's just a forward message. If you resend, is just your money you send.

An advice for you after receiving this kind of calls is "don't check your account balance" , "don't refund", "don't care"

Any attempt you make with your account might mistakenly mistakenly validate the withdrawal message they have sent to your phone!

Beware and stay safe!
