## Adjust Power Settings: 

---

Go to Settings > System > Power & sleep and select "Additional power settings" to access the Power Options. Choose a power plan that prioritizes performance, such as "High performance."

## Disable Visual Effects: 

---

Right-click on the Start button, select System, go to the Advanced system settings, and click on the Settings button under Performance. Choose the "Adjust for best performance" option or manually disable specific visual effects that you don't need.

## Uninstall Unnecessary Programs: 

---

Go to Settings > Apps and uninstall any programs or apps that you no longer use or need. This can free up disk space and improve system performance.

## Clean up Disk Space: 

---

Use the built-in Disk Cleanup utility to remove temporary files, system files, and other unnecessary data. Open File Explorer, right-click on the drive you want to clean (usually C:), select Properties, go to the General tab, and click on the "Disk Cleanup" button.

## Disable Background Apps: 

---

Go to Settings > Privacy > Background apps and disable any apps that you don't want running in the background. This can help conserve system resources and improve performance.

## Optimize Startup Programs: 

---

Open Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc, go to the Startup tab, and disable any programs that you don't need to start with Windows. This can reduce startup time and improve overall performance.

## Adjust Virtual Memory: 

---

Virtual memory is used when your physical RAM is running low. You can optimize it by going to Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Performance > Settings > Advanced > Virtual Memory. Select "Custom size" and set an appropriate initial and maximum size for the virtual memory.

## Update Drivers: 

---

Ensure that all your device drivers are up to date by visiting the manufacturer's website or using a driver update utility. Outdated or incompatible drivers can cause performance issues.

## Disable Windows Tips and Notifications: 

---

Go to Settings > System > Notifications & actions and disable the "Get tips, tricks, and suggestions" option. This can reduce unnecessary notifications and improve system performance.

## Upgrade Hardware: 

---

If your computer is still experiencing performance issues after optimizing Windows, consider upgrading your hardware components, such as adding more RAM or upgrading to a solid-state drive (SSD).

Remember to regularly maintain your computer by keeping it clean from dust, running regular scans for malware, and ensuring that all software and drivers are up to date.



Bye for now.
