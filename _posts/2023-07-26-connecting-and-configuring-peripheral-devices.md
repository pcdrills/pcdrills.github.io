## Connect the peripheral device: 

---

Connect your printer, scanner, or external device to your computer using the appropriate cables (USB, HDMI, etc.). Make sure the device is powered on.

## Install device drivers: 

---

In most cases, Windows 10 will automatically detect and install the necessary drivers for your peripheral device. However, if the device does not install automatically, you may need to insert the installation disc that came with the device or visit the manufacturer's website to download and install the drivers manually.

## Open Settings: 

---

Click on the Start button, then click on the gear-shaped icon to open the Settings app.

## Go to Devices: 

---

In the Settings app, click on "Devices" to open the Devices settings.

## Add a device: 

---

In the left pane of the Devices settings, click on "Printers & scanners" or "Bluetooth & other devices" depending on the type of peripheral device you are connecting.

## Add a printer or scanner: 

---

If you are connecting a printer or scanner, click on "Add a printer or scanner" and wait for Windows to detect and list the available devices. Select the desired device from the list and follow any additional prompts to complete the setup.

## Add a Bluetooth or other device: 

---

If you are connecting an external device such as a Bluetooth speaker or wireless mouse, click on "Add Bluetooth or other device." Follow the on-screen instructions to pair and connect the device.

## Configure device settings: 

---

Once the peripheral device is connected, you may need to configure its settings. For example, you can set a default printer, adjust scanning preferences, or customize button functions on an external device. To do this, go back to the Devices settings and click on the connected device. From there, you can access specific settings and make any necessary adjustments.

It's important to note that the exact steps may vary slightly depending on the specific peripheral device and its manufacturer. Always refer to the device's user manual or the manufacturer's website for detailed instructions on connecting and configuring the device with Windows 10.


Bye for now.
