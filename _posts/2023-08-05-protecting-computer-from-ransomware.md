## Introduction

---
### What is ransomware?
Ransomware is a type of **malicious software (malware)** that encrypts files on a victim's computer or network, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid. The encryption process essentially locks the files, rendering them unusable without the decryption key that only the attackers possess.

### Ransomware Characteristics / Behaviour
Once the ransomware infects a system, it typically displays a ransom note, providing instructions on how to make the payment to obtain the decryption key. The ransom note often includes warnings that files will be permanently lost or deleted if the ransom is not paid within a specific time frame.

## Probable sources of infection

---
Ransomware can enter a system through various means, including:

### Email Attachments: 
Opening infected email attachments can trigger the execution of ransomware.

### Malicious Links: 
Clicking on malicious links, often received through phishing emails or on compromised websites, can lead to ransomware infection. (Remember those links offering free data that you never seem to get at the end? that's just an example i'll give for better understanding)

### Exploit Kits: 
Ransomware can exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software or operating systems to gain access to the system. (That's why you should try to keep your softwares updated, so that you can benefit from security updates provided by the manufacture of the software.)

### Drive-by Downloads: 
Visiting compromised websites or malicious pop-up windows can automatically download and execute ransomware on a victim's machine.

### Malvertising: 
Ads containing malicious code can distribute ransomware if clicked or viewed.

### Use Reliable Antivirus/Anti-Malware Software: 

---

Install reputable antivirus or anti-malware software on your computer and keep it up to date. Regularly scan your system for any potential threats and ensure real-time protection is enabled. 

Any antivirus that's popular and recommended will be a good option. Just make sure it's always up-to-date.

### Keep Your Operating System and Software Updated: 

---

Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and other software applications. Updates often include security patches that address vulnerabilities that ransomware can exploit.

### Exercise Caution with Email Attachments and Links: 

---

Be vigilant when opening email attachments or clicking on links, especially if they are from **unknown or suspicious sources**. Ransomware often spreads through malicious email attachments or phishing links.

### Be Wary of Downloading Content from Untrusted Sources: 

---

Avoid downloading files, software, or media from untrusted or unreliable sources. Stick to reputable websites and official app stores for downloads.

### Enable Automatic Backups: 

---

**Regularly backup** your important files and data to an external storage device or a reliable cloud service. Automatic backups ensure that even if your system is compromised, you can restore your files without paying a ransom.

### Implement a Network Firewall: 

---

Enable and configure a robust firewall to protect your network from unauthorized access. This helps prevent ransomware from infiltrating your system through network connections.

### Enable Pop-up Blockers and Disable Macros: 

---

Configure your web browser to block pop-ups and disable macros in Office documents. Ransomware may exploit vulnerabilities in these areas.

### Educate Yourself and Your Users: 

---

Stay informed about the latest ransomware trends and techniques. Educate yourself and your users about safe online practices, such as avoiding suspicious websites, being cautious with email attachments, and being vigilant against social engineering tactics.

### Use a Least Privilege Principle: 

---

Limit user accounts and permissions to minimize the impact if a ransomware attack occurs. Users should only have the necessary privileges to perform their tasks, reducing the spread and damage caused by ransomware.

### Create System Restore Points: 

---

Regularly create system restore points for your computer. If your system gets infected, you can restore it to a previous state before the ransomware was present.


> Remember, prevention is the best defense against ransomware. By implementing these measures and staying cautious while using your computer, you can greatly minimize the risk of falling victim to ransomware attacks.
