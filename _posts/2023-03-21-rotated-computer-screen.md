Your can try the following methods:
1️⃣ use the Jerry combination of "Ctrl + Alt + arrow key". The arrow key used depends on how the display is, so in its upsidedown, you know you have to use down arrow key, etc
2️⃣ you can simply go to the settings on your PC and search for display settings. There you'll see how the rotation is and correct it.
3️⃣ If it was a newly installed operating system, probably you'll have to reinstall.
