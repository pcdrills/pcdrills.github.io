## Install antivirus software:  

---

Choose a reputable antivirus program and install it on your Windows 10 PC. Make sure to keep the software updated to protect against the latest threats.

## Enable Windows Defender:  

---

Windows 10 comes with built-in antivirus protection called Windows Defender. Ensure that it is enabled by going to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security and checking that the Windows Defender Antivirus is turned on.

## Keep your operating system up to date:  

---

Regularly install Windows updates to ensure that your PC has the latest security patches. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and click on "Check for updates" to install any available updates.

## Use a strong and unique password:  

---

Create a strong password for your user account and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts. Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords.

## Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):  

---

Enable 2FA for your Microsoft account and any other online accounts that support it. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your smartphone, in addition to your password.

## Be cautious of phishing attempts:  

---

Be vigilant when opening emails or clicking on links from unknown sources. Avoid downloading attachments or clicking on suspicious links that may contain malware.

## Use a firewall:  

---

Enable the built-in Windows Firewall or install a third-party firewall to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.

## Regularly backup your data:  

---

Create regular backups of your important files and store them in a secure location, either offline or in the cloud. This helps protect against data loss in case of malware attacks or hardware failures.

## Be mindful of downloads and software installations:  

---

Only download software from trusted sources and be cautious when installing new programs. Read user reviews and check for any red flags before proceeding with installations.

## Educate yourself and stay informed: 

---

Stay up to date with the latest security threats and best practices for online safety. Regularly educate yourself on common scams and techniques used by hackers to protect yourself and your PC.

Bye for now.
