When buying a new laptop, sometimes a second handed one too, there are several important characteristics to consider. Considering you are not low on budget, then it's best to get the best that would serve all your needs.
Here are some key factors to look for:

## Performance: 

Consider the processor, RAM, and storage capacity of the laptop. A powerful processor (such as an Intel Core i5 or i7) and ample RAM (8GB or more) will ensure smooth multitasking and faster performance. Additionally, a larger storage capacity (preferably SSD for faster data access) will allow you to store more files and programs.

## Display:

Look for a laptop with a high-resolution display (Full HD or higher) and good color accuracy. This is especially important if you plan to use your laptop for tasks such as graphic design or video editing. Additionally, consider the size of the display and whether it suits your needs (e.g., 13-inch for portability or 15-inch for a larger workspace).

## Battery Life: 

If you need to use your laptop on the go, battery life is crucial. Look for a laptop with a long-lasting battery (ideally 8 hours or more) to ensure you can work or play without constantly needing to find a power outlet.

## Portability: 

Consider the weight and size of the laptop if you plan to carry it around frequently. Thin and lightweight laptops are more portable, but keep in mind that they may sacrifice certain features or performance capabilities.

## Connectivity: 

Check the available ports on the laptop to ensure they meet your needs. Common ports include USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and an audio jack. Additionally, consider if the laptop has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.

## Operating System:

Decide whether you prefer Windows, macOS, or Chrome OS. Each operating system has its own advantages and compatibility with different software and applications.

## Keyboard and Trackpad: 

Test the keyboard and trackpad to ensure they are comfortable and responsive. Backlit keyboards can be useful for working in low-light environments.

## Build Quality and Durability: 

Look for a laptop with a sturdy build quality that can withstand everyday use. Consider the material used for the chassis (e.g., aluminum or magnesium alloy) and read reviews to gauge the durability of the laptop.

## Price: 

Set a budget and consider the features and specifications you need within that budget. Compare prices from different manufacturers to find the best value for your money.
