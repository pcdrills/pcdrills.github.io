Using computers, there's no guarantee that you'll never have to deal with a virus at some point in time.

Some spread through portable drives, downloaded files, among others.

    Well, considering we already have it on our computer and are trying to solve the issue, we can proceed by:

    Check if an antivirus program exist on your computer and is up to date.

    Check if there's an anti spyware program and update it

    Run the antivirus software so as to combat threats.

    If all that doesn't help. You could go in for other other recommendable antivirus programs (paid antivirus).

You can still contact a technician if necessary
