In the above image, you instead see "Change" because there's already a password. If you don't yet have, you'll see "Add" instead.

> Remember! Your password has to be hard for other people to guess it, but easy for you to remember it. Don't use obvious things as passwords like date of birth, name, mother's name, pet's name, etc.

- Enter your current account password if prompted.

- Set a new password by typing it into the "New password" field.

- Confirm the new password by retyping it into the "Reenter password" field.

- Optionally, you can add a password hint to help you remember the password if you forget it. It is recommended not to use obvious hints that others may easily guess.
Click on the "Next" button.

- Finally, click on the "Finish" button to complete the process.

Once you've set a password, you will need to enter it every time you log in to your Windows 10 computer. 

> Don't forget your password!!!
