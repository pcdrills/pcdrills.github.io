Adding An Automatic Table Of Content To A Word Document on Microsoft Word

 Hello to all our readers. If you are hear today, it's either you wish to learn something new or support in the growth of our work through your suggestions.


How ever, everyone is here for the weekly tutorial review. Today, our tutorial goes as follows;

    Adding An Automatic Table Of Content To A Word Document.

With the new age of documentation, the quantity of things you have to type have drastically increased. Not only about the amount of people needing things to be typed, also by the quantity of content in one typed document. Take as example:
A teacher who want's to type a textbook for his subject. Such a textbook won't be less than a hundred pages. Maybe he'll need a workbook for the book in question.

In a book, we have the various parts that take into consideration multiple pages in the document. For example the Table of Contents , which is our focus of the day. You can decide, type the whole document in word and put the table of contents after you finally assume through with the editing. But did you know the owner could bring some changes a few munites or hours later?? Maybe for you to remove a paragraph found on the first page. Or probably to insert a page break or a new chapter at a particular location. Adding that, is not the problem, the issue is at the level of the table of contents you'll have to edit multibple pages just to make it match with the current edits. And maybe that edit won't even be the final one. Haha... That's the issue we are handling today,

A method in which you simple have to click a button to check for any updates in the values in your table of content and update them accordingly within seconds. With this, you literally take the whole stress off you hands and eyes, having to screen, scroll and edit through.

Doing this is very simple to those who have been doing it and seem complicated to those who are new to it. And with the explanation we give here, it won't only help you to generate the table of contents, there are other things you can generate such as List of Tables, List of Figures, and others. What you need to do is to understand the concept behind it.

Without making the theory too long, let's get practical about it. Follow up through the video and hopefully you'll get the idea. For any questions, contact us throught any of the links you find on this site.
