>    NB: Before you get into online business, start by tlearning more about the sites you should and should not be dealing with.
It is very very important to learn first so as to alway know the risk involved. ❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕

## 1. Check the legal notices:
> On a commercial site, the legal notices are compulsory. They consist of the name, contact details and Siret number of the owner of the said site. If you never find a "legal notice" page, run away.

## 2. Check the general conditions of sale: 
> Any trusted site has its page displaying its conditions of sale or use. Usually, this is a series of articles in which the shipping conditions, withdrawal conditions or even the delivery time or even the price are explained.


## 3. Check for the presence of the https protocol: 
> This is perhaps the first reflex you should have when you arrive on a commercial site or on a social network. It's easy to find it, it's at the top of your search bar. The https protocol is all the more important on payment pages. If the acronym https does not appear on the page, quit immediately otherwise you will be robbed


## 4. Use [WHOIS](https://whois.com): Literally “who is? ". 
> This service lets you know virtually everything about a website. This therefore allows you to know if the site you are visiting is a real one or a scam. And to use the WHOIS, nothing could be simpler. You just need to search for "whois + site name". Easy we told you.

> Be careful, if you don't find any information via WHOIS, the site you are visiting is probably a fake.

## 5. Use the foxyrating platform: 
> This platform gives you the opinions of users on online services and website and their creation date

## 6. Do not invest your money on newly created platforms. 
> For example, an investment platform which has only 6 to 9 months of existence is not reliable because an anarchist on the internet does not generally last. On the other hand, an investment platform which has 4 years of existence is more reliable unlike one which is only 9 months old.

## 7. Learn to spot a ponzi scheme. 
> Indeed, a Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent financial arrangement which consists in remunerating clients' investments mainly with funds provided by new entrants. If the scam is not discovered, it appears in broad daylight when it collapses, that is to say when the sums provided by new entrants are no longer sufficient to cover the salaries of the old ones. It takes its name from Charles Ponzi. Let's imagine that someone offers an investment at 100% interest: you give him 10 euros, he returns 20 euros using the money deposited by the following clients (he just needs to offer a return double the returns known in the market to attract customers and to last). The system is viable as long as the clientele arrives, attracted en masse by the financial promises (and all the more tempting when the first investors are satisfied and make a formidable advertisement for the placement). The first clients, too happy with this wonderful investment, put their money back too, adding to all those they managed to convince. When a platform promises you high interest rates in such a short time or double your earnings if you invite other people run away because it's a ponzi scheme

> Here it ends, but those are just a few things to look out for. Stay safe and always be vigilant. You can always ask others for their own experiences from a site you are not familiar with, and you can always do a quick google search about the site in question.
