## Introduction

---
Explaining with words sometimes might be hard to understand or might not just be enough, that's why sometimes, we need to show what we are actually talking about.
Today, we take a look at how we can take a screenshot on our windows 10 computer so we can share what we are seeing or do something else with it.

## Procedure

> These are key combinations, so these keys have to be pressed all at once to make it work. You press the first and hold without releasing, press the next and hold and so on.

To take a screenshot on Windows 10, you can use one of the following methods:

### Method 1

Press the "Print Screen" key (sometimes labeled as "PrtScn") on your keyboard. This will capture an image of your entire screen and save it to the clipboard. You can then paste the screenshot into an image editing program or document.

---

### Method 2

Press the "Windows key + Print Screen" keys on your keyboard. This will capture an image of your entire screen and save it to a folder called "Screenshots" in your Pictures folder.

---

### Method 3

Press the "Alt + Print Screen" keys on your keyboard. This will capture an image of the active window and save it to the clipboard. You can then paste the screenshot into an image editing program or document.

### Method 4

Use the built-in "Snipping Tool" app. This allows you to select a portion of the screen to capture and save as an image. To access this app, search for "Snipping Tool" in the Start menu or use the Windows key + Shift + S shortcut to open the Snip & Sketch tool.

## Conclusions
Any method that works best for you, you can you use it, it's not obligatory to follow a particular style.

> If it works for you, then that's great!
If it doesn't work for you then you are probably not respecting the sequence.
You can always get in touch with us with your further questions.
