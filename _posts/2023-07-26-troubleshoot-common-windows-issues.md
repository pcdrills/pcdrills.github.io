## Update Windows: 

---

Make sure your operating system is up to date by going to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and clicking on "Check for updates." Install any available updates.

## Restart your computer: 

---

Sometimes a simple restart can resolve common issues. Click on the Start button, select the Power icon, and choose "Restart."

## Run Windows Troubleshooter: 

---

Windows 10 has built-in troubleshooters that can automatically detect and fix common problems. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot and select the relevant troubleshooter for your issue, such as "Windows Update," "Internet Connections," or "Audio."

## Check for driver updates: 

---

Outdated or incompatible drivers can cause various issues. Open Device Manager by right-clicking on the Start button and selecting it from the menu. Expand the categories and right-click on a device to update its driver.

## Scan for malware: 

---

Malware can cause system instability and performance issues. Use Windows Security (previously Windows Defender) or a reputable antivirus program to scan your computer for malware and remove any threats.

## Disable unnecessary startup programs: 

---

Certain programs may start automatically with Windows and slow down your computer's performance. Open Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc, go to the Startup tab, and disable any programs that you don't need to start with Windows.

## Reset Windows Store cache: 

---

If you're having issues with Microsoft Store apps, resetting the cache can help. Press Windows key + R, type "wsreset.exe" (without quotes), and press Enter. The Microsoft Store will open, and the cache will be reset.

## Check for disk errors: 

---

Disk errors can cause system crashes and data loss. Open File Explorer, right-click on the drive you want to check (usually C:), select Properties, go to the Tools tab, and click on "Check" under Error checking. Follow the on-screen instructions to scan and repair disk errors.

## Restore system files: 

---

Corrupted system files can cause various issues. Open Command Prompt as an administrator by right-clicking on the Start button and selecting it from the menu. Type "sfc /scannow" (without quotes) and press Enter. Wait for the scan to complete, and it will attempt to repair any corrupted files.

## Perform a clean boot: 

---

If you're experiencing issues that might be caused by third-party software, performing a clean boot can help identify the culprit. Press Windows key + R, type "msconfig" (without quotes), and press Enter. In the System Configuration window, go to the Services tab, check "Hide all Microsoft services," then click on "Disable all." Go to the Startup tab and click on "Open Task Manager." Disable all startup items, close Task Manager, and click on OK in the System Configuration window. Restart your computer.

If none of these troubleshooting steps resolve your issue, you may need to seek additional help from Microsoft support or a professional technician.


Bye for now.
